//Difference between  let , var and const 

const name = "one"
let email = "one@gmail.com"
var password = "123456"

// name = "two"
email = "two@gmail.com"
password = "abcdef"

console.log(name, email, password);

// 


// Why not to use the var ?
// It has issue on block scope and functional scope
